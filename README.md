### About development
I used Figma to sketch the layout and the design.
Once the prototype was completed, I started coding the index.php - creating the layout and structure the website, section by section.
I then started styling the overall layout, using css grid. And then styling the elements. I continued section by section.
The last section I was coding was "contact" where I added email.php to process the form data.
Alongside I was adding JavaScript to the site (for toggle navigation, tabs, and finally for form validation).
I was continuously testing responsiveness and functionality of all elements and refactoring the code accordingly.
In the final stage I checked all the parts for errors, deleted unnecessary lines of code, restructured some parts semantically and refactored code, trying to make it clean and comprehensive.
